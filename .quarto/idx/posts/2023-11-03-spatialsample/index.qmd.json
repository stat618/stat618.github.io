Data in geographic coordinates was actually already using these slightly larger grids, [due to issues with straight-line grids in non-planar CRS](https://github.com/ropensci/stplanr/pull/467), so this change just makes the amount of grid expansion controllable there.\n\nThe other breaking change/bug-fix is in `spatial_nndm_cv()`. The `prediction_sites` argument to `spatial_nndm_cv()` lets you specify the actual sites you were going to generate predictions at. In older versions of spatialsample, if any of the data in `prediction_sites` weren't points, then this function would instead randomly sample points from inside the bounding box of the entire `prediction_sites` object.\n\nStarting with spatialsample 0.5.0, passing a single polygon to `prediction_sites` will cause `spatial_nndm_cv()` to instead sample points from inside that polygon, allowing you fine-grained control over the boundaries for this sampling stage. This feels like a more intuitive interface, and you can always revert to previous behaviors by passing `sf::st_as_sf(sf::st_as_sfc(sf::st_bbox(prediction_sites)))` if you'd rather sample from the bounding box instead.\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\nThe [newest version of spatialsample](https://github.com/tidymodels/spatialsample), the tidymodels package I maintain for spatial cross-validation, just landed on CRAN, with binaries for Windows and Mac coming in the next few days. \n\nThis release mostly fixes a few bugs in `spatial_block_cv()` and `spatial_nndm_cv()`.
