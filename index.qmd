## Bio

Hello! My name is **Likang LI**. Here is my homepage, I try to make it
interesting!🙌<br> I am currently an Mphil student, majoring in
Probability and Mathematical Statistics at [BNU-HKBU United
International College](https://www.uic.edu.cn/en/), supervised by Prof.
[**Jianxin PAN**](https://uic.edu.cn/en/faculty.htm#/jianxinpan/en). I
received my first Master degree from Hong Kong Baptist University in
2022 and my Bachelor's degree in Network Engineering from Henan
University in 2020.

My research interests focus on statistical computing and data science. 
At the same time, I love to code 💻 and aim to extend my research through code! 
In life, I love running🏃 and swimming🏊, which
makes me free and happy!<br> 
Email✉ me if you want to connect with me
for any fun or collaboration! 
I'm always eager to learn more and expand my horizons!
