Software citations are particularly poorly captured by things like Google Scholar, both because software exists outside of standard citation formats and because software citations are often poorly formatted in publications. For that reason, I find it useful to keep my own list of projects which have cited my work.\n\nIf you cited any of my packages in a publication, please let me know -- either on [Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@MikeMahoney218) or via email at [mike.mahoney.218+site@gmail.com](mailto:mike.mahoney.218+site@gmail.com) . I can't guarantee I'll add them to this list, [for secret reasons](https://www.jasongurley.com/quote-wall-white/), but it always makes me happy to see.\n\n## How to cite software\n\nThe rOpenSci blog has [a fantastic post on how to cite R and R packages](https://ropensci.org/blog/2021/11/16/how-to-cite-r-and-r-packages/), which I quickly summarize below. I highly recommend their post, however, even if you aren't an R user; most of the topic generalizes to other software pretty easily.\n\nA software citation serves two functions for your readers:\n\n+ Tells them _what you did_; for instance, if I see someone cite the `sf` package, I suddenly know more about the details of their spatial calculations than I can probably get from the text alone.\n+ Tells them _how you did it_; package version information and source information helps others to replicate your work, and also can help readers assess an analysis. If you use `sf` >= 1.0.0, for instance, I know that you probably didn't run into issues doing distance calculations with geographic coordinates, so I don't need to consider that when I'm reading your results.\n\nSoftware citations also help the developers of your packages justify developing packages further; if you're a user of scientific software and want there to still _be_ scientific software in the future, you should cite your software. It also makes me, personally, feel great to see people benefiting from my work, and to see them credit me for any help my software gave them! \n\nAs such, you should cite any package that was relevant to the study you performed. If uninstalling the package (or deleting the relevant function calls) would change your results or make your code not run, you should cite it.\n\nIf you _are_ an R user, you can get the citations for both R and your packages using the `citation()` function:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncitation()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nTo cite R in publications use:\n\n  R Core Team (2023). _R: A Language and Environment for Statistical\n  Computing_. R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria.\n  <https://www.R-project.org/>.\n\nA BibTeX entry for LaTeX users is\n\n  @Manual{,\n    title = {R: A Language and Environment for Statistical Computing},\n    author = {{R Core Team}},\n    organization = {R Foundation for Statistical Computing},\n    address = {Vienna, Austria},\n    year = {2023},\n    url = {https://www.R-project.org/},\n  }\n\nWe have invested a lot of time and effort in creating R, please cite it\nwhen using it for data analysis. See also 'citation(\"pkgname\")' for\nciting R packages.\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncitation(\"rsample\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nTo cite package 'rsample' in publications use:\n\n  Frick H, Chow F, Kuhn M, Mahoney M, Silge J, Wickham H (2023).\n  _rsample: General Resampling Infrastructure_.\n  https://rsample.tidymodels.org,\n  https://github.com/tidymodels/rsample.\n\nA BibTeX entry for LaTeX users is\n\n  @Manual{,\n    title = {rsample: General Resampling Infrastructure},\n    author = {Hannah Frick and Fanny Chow and Max Kuhn and Michael Mahoney and Julia Silge and Hadley Wickham},\n    year = {2023},\n    note = {https://rsample.tidymodels.org,\nhttps://github.com/tidymodels/rsample},\n  }\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIf you _aren't_ an R user, many scientific software libraries will still provide information on how to cite them -- for instance, [here's the instructions for citing numpy](https://numpy.org/citing-numpy/). If Google and such return nothing, then I think your best option is to style citations after the official R citation: mimic book citation style, using authors, year, title, publication location, and an accessible URL.\n\n## How I track citations\n\nAs suggested in [a different rOpenSci post](https://ropensci.org/blog/2021/02/16/package-citation/#how-ropensci-tracks-package-usage), I find the best general tool I have for finding software citations is to set up a Google Scholar alert for my packages and investigate each alert as it comes in. This is not a foolproof method, and I'm sure I miss things; as mentioned above, if you cited any of my packages in a publication, please let me know either on [Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@MikeMahoney218) or via email at [mike.mahoney.218+site@gmail.com](mailto:mike.mahoney.218+site@gmail.com) .\n\nI only track citations for packages I'm an author on, once I'm an author on them. In cases where a paper mentions the package but doesn't cite it, I only list the article if it was published after I became an author on the package.\n\nWhile I track both citations and mentions of my packages, I really want to stress that citations are fantastic, help me justify maintaining open source scientific software (both to my boss and to myself), and make me really happy. Mentions do not. If you are going to mention one of these packages, please give it a full citation.\n\nThe citations below are in a variety of formats; I'll confess to copying journal \"cite this article\" citations without reformatting for this list. If I messed up my citation for your article, please get in touch to let me know.\n\n## Software citations\n\n### terrainr\n\n#. Henderson, A. F., Cheeseman, T., Curcio, N., Marcías, M.
