The models don't need to incorporate spatial information at all for these methods to be useful. I'll admit that it's a bit clunky, though, and have a habit of lapsing back to \"spatial models\".] has passed peer review and been accepted to [rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org/). As always, [the review process](https://github.com/ropensci/software-review/issues/571) improved the package immensely, thanks to the thoughtful reviews of [Virgilio GÃ³mez-Rubio](https://becarioprecario.github.io/) and [Jakub Nowosad](https://jakubnowosad.com/)^[Only a little intimidating having my package reviewed by the authors of two of the best books on using R for spatial analysis!], as well as the shepherding of [Anna Krystalli](https://www.r-rse.eu/) and [Paula Moraga](https://www.paulamoraga.com/) as editors.\n\nAs of Monday, the reviewed version has officially [made its way to CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=waywiser). This is a [huge update](https://docs.ropensci.org/waywiser/news/index.html#waywiser-030), bringing in a ton of new functions and improving consistency and speed across the package, and I'm excited to have it officially released.\n\nI'm also very excited to have put out a [preprint describing the package](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11312), which goes a bit deeper into the logic of why and how the package implements the features it does. This is my first solo-authored paper,^[And frankly, I don't intend to make it a habit. I highly appreciate working with collaborators, particularly with my current research group, and know that my work is usually better for having gone through multiple rounds of revisions before being released. I really missed that process while working on this paper!] and by far and away the one with the most equations.^[23 numbered equations! My undergraduate degree is in ecology, where [each additional equation per page is associated with 28% fewer citations](https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.1205259109); four years ago I'd never have expected I'd be writing a paper that looks like this] Despite both of those, I'm pretty pleased with how this paper turned out; I think it's a useful addition to the package documentation for users who want a more thorough explication of the scholarly background of package features.\n",
