I learned this last week, evidently.\nsudo\nls\nfind\nquarto # I don't think this includes rendering from RStudio! \ngrep\nrm\ngdalwarp # -multi -co NUM_THREADS=ALL_CPUS -co COMPRESS=DEFLATE \\ \n# -co PREDICTOR=3 -co BIGTIFF=YES\nra # My alias for radian -- https://github.com/randy3k/radian\nnano # Possibly from teaching Software Carpentry lessons\ncat\ndocker # I always teach using https://hub.docker.com/r/rocker/rstudio\nrsync\ncargo\nhtop\nxkill # No, *you're* cheating at Crusader Kings\npip\nssh\nR # Interesting to me that I have three separate R calls here\nRscript\ncurl\nmkdir\nlabrador # Alias to SSH into another computer\nconvert # Have done a _lot_ of image processing work for the PhD\ntmux # Highly, highly recommend https://github.com/tmux/tmux\nqvm # The _only_ way to use Quarto https://github.com/dpastoor/qvm\nping # I break my local network more than I care to admit\ngdal_calc.py \nkillall # \"Whoops, accidentally used all threads for that job again\"\necho\nco # Alias to SSH into another computer\ncp\nogr2ogr # Called a lot, but called _correctly_ very rarely\nmv\npython # More often called from inside an IDE\nogrinfo\nhistory\nwhich\ntouch\nwc\nsource\ngdalinfo\ndu # Doing spatial modeling on local compute resources is... rough\nsshpi # Alias to SSH into another computer\nsed\ngdal_translate\nffmpeg # Surprisingly useful for conference talks\nwget\nscp\n```\n\nI'm surprised by how much more I use gdalwarp than the rest of the suite! But\notherwise, this all makes pretty intuitive sense to me.\n",
