There are two kinds of creative advice that I think you can get from creative people. The first is how to buy more lottery tickets, and the second is how to win the lottery. And I think the former can be extremely useful, and I think the latter is nonsense.

<hr id = "MoroCopShit">

I admit that I am perhaps missing part of a larger picture that encourages or even requires the use of cop shit in the classroom. Yet when my students come to me with reams of documentation for a simple cold, or fearful that I will dole out unexcused absences for them taking job interviews, I have to wonder what that larger picture could be. I’ve only taught for a few semesters and I don’t pretend that my experiences are generalizable to the level of empirical data, but my students seem to do perfectly well in the absence—as much as I can make—of cop shit.

So why do we have cop shit in our classrooms?

One provisional answer is that the people who sell cop shit are very good at selling cop shit, whether that cop shit takes the form of a learning management system or a new pedagogical technique. Like any product, cop shit claims to solve a problem. We might express that problem like this: the work of managing a classroom, at all its levels, is increasingly complex and fraught, full of poorly defined standards, distractions to our students’ attentions, and new opportunities for grift. Cop shit, so cop shit argues, solves these problems by bringing order to the classroom. Cop shit defines parameters. Cop shit ensures compliance. Cop shit gives students and teachers alike instant feedback in the form of legible metrics.

In short, cop shit operates according the the logic of datafication.

[...]

Cop shit is seductive. It makes metrics transparent. It allows for the clear progress toward learning objectives. It also subsumes education within a market logic. “Here,” cop shit says, “you will learn how to do this thing. We will know you learned it by the acquisition of this gold star. But in order for me to award you this gold star, I must parse you, sense you, track you, collect you, and—” here’s the key, “I will presume that you will attempt to flout me at every turn. We are both scamming each other, you and I, and I intend to win.” When a classroom becomes adversarial, of course, as cop shit presumes, then there must be a clear winner and loser. The student’s education then becomes not a victory for their own self-improvement or -enrichment, but rather that the teacher conquered the student’s presumed inherent laziness, shiftiness, etc. to instill some kernel of a lesson.

My second meta-principle of statistics is the methodological attribution problem, 
which is that the many useful contributions of a good statistical consultant, or 
collaborator, will often be attributed to the statistician’s methods or 
philosophy rather than to the artful efforts of the statistician himself or 
herself. Don Rubin has told me that scientists are fundamentally Bayesian
(even if they do not realize it), in that they interpret uncertainty intervals 
Bayesianly. Brad Efron has talked vividly about how his scientific collaborators 
find permutation tests and p-values to be the most convincing form of evidence. 
Judea Pearl assures me that graphical models describe how people really think 
about causality. And so on. I am sure that all these accomplished researchers, 
and many more, are describing their experiences accurately. 
Rubin wielding a posterior distribution is a powerful thing, as is Efron with a 
permutation test or Pearl with a graphical model, and I believe that
(a) all three can be helping people solve real scientific problems, and 
(b) it is natural for their collaborators to attribute some of these 
researchers’ creativity to their methods.

The result is that each of us tends to come away
from a collaboration or consulting experience with the
warm feeling that our methods really work, and that
they represent how scientists really think. In stating
this, I am not trying to espouse some sort of empty
pluralism — the claim that, for example, we would be
doing just as well if we were all using fuzzy sets, or
correspondence analysis, or some other obscure statistical method. 
There is certainly a reason that methodological advances are made, 
and this reason is typically that existing methods have their failings. 
Nonetheless, I think we all have to be careful about attributing too
much from our collaborators’ and clients’ satisfaction with our methods.

<hr id = "GorardEven">

Even one of the most elementary things taught on a statistics course, the standard deviation, is more complex than it need be, and is considered here as an example of how convenience for mathematical manipulation often over-rides pragmatism in research methods.

[...]

In essence, the claim made for the standard deviation is that we can compute a number (SD) from our observations that has a relatively consistent relationship with a number computed in the same way form the population figures. This claim, in itself, is of no great value. Reliability alone does not make that number of any valid use. For example, if the computation led to a _constant_ whatever figures were used then there would be a perfectly consistent relationship between the parameters for the sample and population. But to what end? Surely the key issue is not how stable the statistic but whether it encapsulates what we want it to.

[...]

Of course, much of the rest of traditional statistics is now based on the standard deviation, but it is important to realise that it need not be.

<hr id = "GelmanInvite">

There was some discussion in the comments thread here about axis labels and zero. Sometimes zero has no particular meaning (for example when graphing degrees Fahrenheit), but usually it has a clear interpretation, in which case it can be pleasant to include it on the graph. On the other hand, if you’re plotting something that varies from, say 184 to 197, it would typically be a bad idea to extend the axis all the way to zero, as this would destroy your visual resolution.

The advice we usually give is: If zero is in the neighborhood, invite it in.

Software people are not alone in facing complexity. Physics deals with terribly 
complex objects even at the “fundamental” particle level. The physicist labors
on, however, in a firm faith that there are unifying principles to be found, 
whether in quarks or in unified field theories. Einstein repeatedly argued that 
there must be simplified explanations of nature, because God is not capricious 
or arbitrary. 

No such faith comforts the software engineer. Much of the complexity he must 
master is arbitrary complexity, forced without rhyme or reason by the many human 
institutions and systems to which his interfaces must confirm. These differ from 
interface to interface, and from time to time, not because of necessity but only 
because they were designed by different people, rather than by God.

georeferenced data.

Imagine, for example, a young child going to a Digital Earth exhibit at a local 
museum. After donning a head-mounted display, she sees Earth as it appears from 
space. Using a data glove, she zooms in, using higher and higher levels of 
resolution, to see continents, then regions, countries, cities, and finally 
individual houses, trees, and other natural and man-made objects. Having found 
an area of the planet she is interested in exploring, she takes the equivalent 
of a ‘magic carpet ride’ through a 3-D visualization of the terrain. Of course, 
terrain is only one of the many kinds of data with which she can interact.

She is able to request information on land cover, distribution of plant and

<hr id = "EfronRejoinder">

An extra year of experience has not changed my belief in a disconnect between 
traditional statistical regression methods and the pure prediction algorithms. 
Section 8 of the paper, featuring Table 5, makes the case directly in terms of 
six criteria. Five of the six emerged more or less unscathed from the discussion. 
Criteria 2, long-time scientific truth versus possibly short-term prediction 
accuracy, was doubted by FHT and received vigorous push-back from Yu/Barter:

> ...but in our experience the “truth” that traditional regression methods supposedly represent is rarely justified or validated...

This is a hard-line Breimanian point of view. That "rarely" is over the top. The 
truism that begins “all models are wrong” ends with “but some are useful.” 
Traditional models tend to err on the side of over-simplicity (not enough 
interactions, etc.) but still manage to capture at least some aspect of the 
underlying mechanism. “Eternal truth” is a little too much to ask for, but in 
the Neonate example we did wind up believing that respiratory strength had 
something lasting to do with the babies’ survival.

[...]

The fathers of statistical theory — Pearson, Fisher, Neyman, Hotelling, Wald —
forgot to provide us with a comprehensive theory of optimal prediction. We will 
have to count on the current generation of young statisticians to fill the gap 
and put prediction on a principled foundation.

<hr id = "TrattWhat">

It's important to be realistic: most people don't care about program performance most of the time. Modern computers are so fast that most programs run fast enough even with very slow language implementations. In that sense, I agree with Daniel's premise: optimising compilers are often unimportant. But “often” is often unsatisfying, as it is here. Users find themselves transitioning from not caring at all about performance to suddenly really caring, often in the space of a single day.

This, to me, is where optimising compilers come into their own: they mean that even fewer people need care about program performance. And I don't mean that they get us from, say, 98 to 99 people out of 100 not needing to care: it's probably more like going from 80 to 99 people out of 100 not needing to care. This is, I suspect, more significant than it seems: it means that many people can go through an entire career without worrying about performance. Martin Berger reminded me of A N Whitehead’s wonderful line that “civilization advances by extending the number of important operations which we can perform without thinking about them” and this seems a classic example of that at work.

There are two cultures in the use of statistical modeling to reach conclusions 
from data. One assumes that the data are generated by a given stochastic data 
model. The other uses algorithmic models and treats the data mechanism as 
unknown. The statistical community has been committed to the almost exclusive 
use of data models. This commitment has led to irrelevant theory, questionable 
conclusions, and has kept statisticians from working on a large range of 
interesting current problems.

The first of McIlroy's dicta is often paraphrased as "do one thing and do it well", which is shortened from "Make each program do one thing well. To do a new job, build afresh rather than complicate old programs by adding new 'features.'"

McIlroy's example of this dictum is:

> Surprising to outsiders is the fact that UNIX compilers produce no listings: printing can be done better and more flexibly by a separate program.

[...]

McIlroy implies that the problem is that people didn't think hard enough, the old school UNIX mavens would have sat down in the same room and thought longer and harder until they came up with a set of consistent tools that has "unusual simplicity". But that was never going to scale, the philosophy made the mess we're in inevitable. It's not a matter of not thinking longer or harder; it's a matter of having a philosophy that cannot scale unless you have a relatively small team with a shared cultural understanding, able to to sit down in the same room.

If anyone can write a tool and the main instruction comes from "the unix philosophy", people will have different opinions about what "simplicity" or "doing one thing" means, what the right way to do things is, and inconsistency will bloom, resulting in the kind of complexity you get when dealing with a wildly inconsistent language, like PHP. People make fun of PHP and javascript for having all sorts of warts and weird inconsistencies, but as a language and a standard library, any commonly used shell plus the collection of widely used *nix tools taken together is much worse and contains much more accidental complexity due to inconsistency even within a single Linux distro and there's no other way it could have turned out. If you compare across Linux distros, BSDs, Solaris, AIX, etc., the amount of accidental complexity that users have to hold in their heads when switching systems dwarfs PHP or javascript's incoherence. The most widely mocked programming languages are paragons of great design by comparison.

To be clear, I'm not saying that I or anyone else could have done better with the knowledge available in the 70s in terms of making a system that was practically useful at the time that would be elegant today. It's easy to look back and find issues with the benefit of hindsight. What I disagree with are comments from Unix mavens speaking today; comments like McIlroy's, which imply that we just forgot or don't understand the value of simplicity, or Ken Thompson saying that C is as safe a language as any and if we don't want bugs we should just write bug-free code. These kinds of comments imply that there's not much to learn from hindsight; in the 70s, we were building systems as effectively as anyone can today; five decades of collective experience, tens of millions of person-years, have taught us nothing; if we just go back to building systems like the original Unix mavens did, all will be well. I respectfully disagree.

This isn't to say there's no cost to adding options -- more options means more maintenance burden, but that's a cost that maintainers pay to benefit users, which isn't obviously unreasonable considering the ratio of maintainers to users. This is analogous to Gary Bernhardt's comment that it's reasonable to practice a talk fifty times since, if there's a three hundred person audience, the ratio of time spent watching to the talk to time spent practicing will still only be 1:6.

1467: Japan’s Feudal system collapses. Sengoku period starts, permanent internal warfare. No side could get an upper hand.

76 years later, the first Musket arrives in Japan (1543). Full adoption into the battle around 1570s; decisive in battle from 1575. 

From 1615 onward: Japan unified, century of peace. 108 years of war, ended in 40 years.

Prolonged warfare is terrible.

Superior weaponry does not always mean more civilian casualties.

Some people argue that the terrible power of nuclear weapons are what enabled the last 75 years without World Wars.

Data analysis is hard, and part of the problem is that few people can explain how to do it. It’s not that there aren’t any people doing data analysis on a regular basis. It’s that the people who are really good at it have yet to enlighten us about the thought process that goes on in their heads.

Imagine you were to ask a songwriter how she writes her songs. There are many tools upon which she can draw. We have a general understanding of how a good song should be structured: how long it should be, how many verses, maybe there’s a verse followed by a chorus, etc. In other words, there’s an abstract framework for songs in general. Similarly, we have music theory that tells us that certain combinations of notes and chords work well together and other combinations don’t sound good. As good as these tools might be, ultimately, knowledge of song structure and music theory alone doesn’t make for a good song. Something else is needed.

In Donald Knuth’s legendary 1974 essay Computer Programming as an Art, Knuth talks about the difference between art and science. In that essay, he was trying to get across the idea that although computer programming involved complex machines and very technical knowledge, the act of writing a computer program had an artistic component. In this essay, he says that

> Science is knowledge which we understand so well that we can teach it to a computer.

Everything else is art.

At some point, the songwriter must inject a creative spark into the process to bring all the songwriting tools together to make something that people want to listen to. This is a key part of the art of songwriting. That creative spark is difficult to describe, much less write down, but it’s clearly essential to writing good songs. If it weren’t, then we’d have computer programs regularly writing hit songs. For better or for worse, that hasn’t happened yet.

Much like songwriting (and computer programming, for that matter), it’s important to realize that data analysis is an art. It is not something yet that we can teach to a computer.

The statistical community has been committed to the almost exclusive use of data 
models. This commitment has led to irrelevant theory, questionable conclusions, 
and has kept statisticians from working on a large range of interesting current 
problems.

parsimony and scientific insight, and in favor of black boxes with lots of knobs 
to twiddle. At second glance it still looks that way, but the paper is 
stimulating, and Leo has some important points to hammer home

[...]

Rule 1. New methods always look better than old ones. Neural nets are better 
than logistic regression, support vector machines are better than neural nets, 
etc. In fact it is very difficult to run an honest simulation comparison, and 
easy to inadvertently cheat by choosing favorable examples, or by not putting as 
much effort into optimizing the dull old standard as the exciting new challenger.

Rule 2. Complicated methods are harder to criticize than simple ones. By now it 
is easy to check the efficiency of a logistic regression, but it is no small 
matter to analyze the limitations of a support vector machine.

Occasionally, one sees frequentism defined in careerist terms, e.g., "A statistician who always rejects null hypotheses at the 95% level will over time make only 5% errors of the first kind." This is not a comforting criterion for the statistician's clients.

[...]

Something important changed in the world of statistics in the new millennium. Twentieth-century statistics, even after the heated expansion of itslate period, could still be contained within the classic Bayesian–frequentist–Fisherian inferential triangle (Figure 14.1). This is not so in the twenty-first century.  Some  of  the  topics  discussed  in  Part  III—false-discovery  rates,post-selection inference, empirical Bayes modeling, the lasso—fit within the triangle but others seem to have escaped, heading south from the frequentist corner, perhaps in the direction of computer science.

People sometimes think (or complain) that working with quantitative data like this inures you to the reality of the human lives that lie behind the numbers. Numbers and measures are crude; they pick up the wrong things; they strip out the meaning of what’s happening to real people; they make it easy to ignore what can’t be counted. There’s something to those complaints. But it’s mostly a lazy critique. In practice, I find that far from distancing you from questions of meaning, quantitative data forces you to confront them. The numbers draw you in. Working with data like this is an unending exercise in humility, a constant compulsion to think through what you can and cannot see, and a standing invitation to understand what the measures really capture—what they mean, and for whom. Those regular spikes in the driving data are the pulse of everyday life as people go out to have a good time at the weekend. That peak there is the Mardi Gras parade in New Orleans. That bump in Detroit was a Garth Brooks concert. Right across the country, that is the sudden shock of the shutdown the second weekend in March. It was a huge collective effort to buy time that, as it turns out, the federal government has more or less entirely wasted. And now through May here comes the gradual return to something like the baseline level of activity from January, proceeding much more quickly in some cities than in others.

I sit at my kitchen-counter observatory and look at the numbers. Before my coffee is ready, I can quickly pull down a few million rows of data courtesy of a national computer network originally designed by the government to be disaggregated and robust, because they were convinced that was what it would take for communication to survive a nuclear war. I can process it using software originally written by academics in their spare time, because they were convinced that sophisticated tools should be available to everyone for free. Through this observatory I can look out without even looking up, surveying the scale and scope of the country’s ongoing, huge, avoidable failure. Everything about this is absurd.

Surgisphere appears to be the Theranos, or possibly the Cornell Food and Brand Lab, of medical research, and Lancet is a serial enabler of research fraud (see this news article by Michael Hiltzik), and it’s easy to focus on that. But remember all the crappy papers these journals publish that don’t get retracted, cos they’re not fraudulent, they’re just crappy. Retracting papers just cos they’re crappy—no fraud, they’re just bad science—I think that’s never ever ever gonna happen. Retraction is taken as some kind of personal punishment meted out to an author and a journal. This frustrates me to no end. What’s important is the science, not the author. But it’s not happening. So, when we hear about glamorous/seedy stories of fraud, remember the bad research, the research that’s not evilicious but just incompetent, maybe never even had a chance of working. That stuff will stay in the published literature forever, and journals love publishing it.

As we say in statistics, the shitty is the enemy of the good.

9. Open code, open data, open review . . .

Just remember, honesty and transparency are not enuf. Open data and code don’t mean your work is any good. A preregistered study can be a waste of time. The point of open data and code is that it makes it easier to do post-publication review. If you’re open, it makes it easier for other people to find flaws in your work. And that’s a good thing.

So: the technical reason we started counting arrays at zero is that in the mid-1960’s, you could shave a few cycles off of a program’s compilation time on an IBM 7094. The social reason is that we had to save every cycle we could, because if the job didn’t finish fast it might not finish at all and you never know when you’re getting bumped off the hardware because the President of IBM just called and fuck your thesis, it’s yacht-racing time.

There are a few points I want to make here.

The first thing is that as far as I can tell nobody has ever actually looked this up.

Whatever programmers think about themselves and these towering logic-engines we’ve erected, we’re a lot more superstitious than we realize. We tell and retell this collection of unsourced, inaccurate stories about the nature of the world without ever doing the research ourselves, and there’s no other word for that but “mythology”. Worse, by obscuring the technical and social conditions that led humans to make these technical and social decisions, by talking about the nature of computing as we find it today as though it’s an inevitable consequence of an immutable set of physical laws, we’re effectively denying any responsibility for how we got here. And worse than that, by refusing to dig into our history and understand the social and technical motivations for those choices, by steadfastly refusing to investigate the difference between a motive and a justification, we’re disavowing any agency we might have over the shape of the future. We just keep mouthing platitudes and pretending the way things are is nobody’s fault, and the more history you learn and the more you look at the sad state of modern computing the the more pathetic and irresponsible that sounds.

An over-simplified and dangerously reductive diagram of a data system might look like this:

    Collection → Computation → Representation

Whenever you look at data — as a spreadsheet or database view or a visualization, you are looking at an artifact of such a system. What this diagram doesn’t capture is the immense branching of choice that happens at each step along the way. As you make each decision — to omit a row of data, or to implement a particular database structure or to use a specific colour palette you are treading down a path through this wild, tall grass of possibility. It will be tempting to look back and see your trail as the only one that you could have taken, but in reality a slightly divergent you who’d made slightly divergent choices might have ended up somewhere altogether different. To think in data systems is to consider all three of these stages at once.

The thing that is most alluring about the Gini coefficient also turns out to be its greatest shortcoming. By collapsing the whole rainbow of the income distribution into a single statistical point of white light, it necessarily conceals much of great interest.

After describing the perverse interaction between wealth gaps, education, mortality trends and political economy, Case and Deaton note that “You could crunch the Gini coefficient to as many decimal places as you like, and you’d learn next to nothing about what’s really going on here.” Quite so, but surely it is unreasonable to demand of one measure of inequality along one dimension that it shed light on complex social interactions or detect causal relationships.

That would be like urging us to abandon the Centigrade scale as a measure of temperature because it so badly fails to inform us about how climate change plays havoc with rainfall patterns, the incidence of extreme weather events, or the extent of sea level rises.  You could calculate average global temperature increases to as many decimal places in degrees Celsius as you liked, and you would be none the wiser about the diversity of consequences of climate change around the world.

A computer is a clock with benefits. They all work the same, doing second-grade math, one step at a time: Tick, take a number and put it in box one. Tick, take another number, put it in box two. Tick, operate (an operation might be addition or subtraction) on those two numbers and put the resulting number in box one. Tick, check if the result is zero, and if it is, go to some other box and follow a new set of instructions.

It’s a good and healthy exercise to ponder what your computer is doing right now. Maybe you’re reading this on a laptop: What are the steps and layers between what you’re doing and the Lilliputian mechanisms within? When you double-click an icon to open a program such as a word processor, the computer must know where that program is on the disk. It has some sort of accounting process to do that. And then it loads that program into its memory—which means that it loads an enormous to-do list into its memory and starts to step through it. What does that list look like?

Maybe you’re reading this in print. No shame in that. In fact, thank you. The paper is the artifact of digital processes. Remember how we put that “a” on screen? See if you can get from some sleepy writer typing that letter on a keyboard in Brooklyn, N.Y., to the paper under your thumb. What framed that fearful symmetry?

One, there’s no magic, no matter how much it looks like there is. There’s just work to make things look like magic.  
And two, it’s crazy in there.

You can tell how well code is organized from across the room. Or by squinting or zooming out. The shape of code from 20 feet away is incredibly informative. Clean code is idiomatic, as brief as possible, obvious even if it’s not heavily documented. Colloquial and friendly. As was written in Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (aka SICP), the seminal textbook of programming taught for years at MIT, “A computer language is not just a way of getting a computer to perform operations -- it is a novel formal medium for expressing ideas about methodology. Thus, programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute.” A great program is a letter from current you to future you or to the person who inherits your code. A generous humanistic document.

Of course all of this is nice and flowery; it needs to work, too.

The Postulates of Mathematics Were Not on the Stone Tablets that Moses Brought Down from Mt. Sinai. It is necessary to emphasize this. We begin with a vague concept in our minds, then we create various sets of postulates, and gradually we settle down to one particular set. In the rigorous postulational approach, the original concept is now replaced by what the postulates define. This makes further evolution of the concept rather difficult and as a result tends to slow down the evolution of mathematics. It is not that the postulation approach is wrong, only that its arbitrariness should be clearly recognized, and we should be prepared to change postulates when the need becomes apparent.

I conclude that there are two ways of constructing a software design: One way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies, and the other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies. The first method is far more difficult. It demands the same skill, devotion, insight, and even inspiration as the discovery of the simple physical laws which underlie the complex phenomena of nature. It also requires a willingness to accept objectives which are limited by physical, logical, and technological constraints, and to accept a compromise when conflicting objectives cannot be met. No committee will ever do this until it is too late.

Then, I express my disagreement, and tell her: "That standard must be our standard. If you are going to be a builder, no other standard is worthwhile. That is what I expect of myself in my own buildings, and it is what I expect of my students." Gradually, I show the students that they have a right to ask this of themselves, and must ask this of themselves. Once that level of standard is in their minds, they will be able to figure out, for themselves, how to do better, how to make something that is as profound as that.

By “good programming,” we mean an approach to the creation of software that relies on systematic thought, planning, and understanding from the very beginning, at every stage, and for every step. To emphasize the point, we speak of systematic program design and systematically designed programs. Critically, the latter articulates the rationale of the desired functionality. Good programming also satisfies an aesthetic sense of accomplishment; the elegance of a good program is comparable to time-tested poems or the black-and-white photographs of a bygone era. In short, programming differs from good programming like crayon sketches in a diner from oil paintings in a museum.

People are much smarter when they can use their full intellect and when they can relate what they are learning to situations or phenomena which are real to them.
The natural reaction, when someone is having trouble understanding what you are explaining, is to break up the explanation into smaller pieces and explain the pieces one by one. This tends not to work, so you back up even further and fill in even more details.

But human minds do not work like computers: it is harder, not easier, to understand something broken down into all the precise little rules than to grasp it as a whole. It is very hard for a person to read a computer assembly language program and figure out what it is about...

Studying mathematics one rule at a time is like studying a language by first memorizing the vocabulary and the detailed linguistic rules, then building phrases and sentences, and only afterwards learning to read, write, and converse. Native speakers of a language are not aware of the linguistic rules: they assimilate the language by focusing on a higher level, and absorbing the rules and patterns subconsciously. The rules and patterns are much harder for people to learn explicitly than is the language itself.

When your mind can separate yourself from your bird, you will share it sooner, and the beauty of the bird will be sooner enjoyed. And what is a bird but for being enjoyed?
